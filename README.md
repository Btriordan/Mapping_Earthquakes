# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using Leaflet and Mapbox, I was able to make a map that consists of the following attributes: 
  1. Three different map views - Street (default), Satellite and dark.
  2. Circle markers whose color and size depend on the magnitude. 
  3. A Legend that shows what each color marker means.
  4. a red line showing the tectonic plates.  I chose red because it was easy to see in all map formats.
  
The default map is in the street view, with the earthquake circle markers, legend and tectonic plate lines showing.
